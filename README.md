# Algorithm-Enthusiasts

## Summary

- This is a repository for algorithm enthusiasts, including general algorithms and specific problems for algorithm enthusiasts to solve.
- all algorithms and problem solutions should be implemented in python
- versions and lib requirements should be marked
- all algorithms and problem solutions should have documentation and tests
