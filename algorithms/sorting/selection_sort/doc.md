# Selection Sort

During the first iteration, look through all elements and select the smallest to swap it with the first element.
Thus the first element will be the smallest.

During the second iteration, look through the second to the last elements and select the smallest in it and swap it
with the second element, thus the second element will be the second smallest after this.

Repeat the process until the end.

the time is O(N) and the space is O(1)
